## Database Design

### Users
Stores information about all users, including guests and hosts.  
**Important Fields:** `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`  
A user can create property listings and make bookings.

### Properties
Represents properties listed by hosts for booking.  
**Important Fields:** `id`, `host_id`, `title`, `location`, `price_per_night`  
Each property belongs to one user (host), but a user can have many properties.

### Bookings
Contains reservation details made by users.  
**Important Fields:** `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`  
A booking links a user to a property and defines the stay duration.

### Payments
Tracks payments related to property bookings.  
**Important Fields:** `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `payment_date`  
Each payment is linked to one booking.

### Reviews
Stores feedback left by users about properties.  
**Important Fields:** `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`  
A user can leave multiple reviews, and each property can have many reviews.

---

### Entity Relationships

- One **User** can have many **Properties**
- One **User** can make many **Bookings**
- One **Property** can have many **Bookings**
- Each **Booking** has one **Payment**
- One **Property** can have many **Reviews**
- One **User** can write many **Reviews**

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. This feature supports both guests and hosts, enabling authentication and role-based access to resources.

### Property Management
Hosts can create, edit, and delete property listings. Each property includes key details such as title, description, location, price, and availability to help users make booking decisions.

### Booking System
Enables users to book available properties for specific dates. The system checks availability and prevents double bookings while allowing users to view and manage their reservations.

### Payment Processing
Handles secure payment transactions linked to bookings. This ensures that users can pay for their reservations safely, and hosts can receive payments reliably.

### Review System
Allows users to leave feedback and ratings on properties they have stayed in. Reviews help improve transparency, build trust, and enhance the decision-making process for future guests.

### API Documentation
Provides well-structured REST and GraphQL API documentation. This supports easy integration, testing, and collaboration by clearly explaining how the backend endpoints can be used.

### Database Optimization
Improves performance by implementing indexing, relationships, and caching. This helps speed up data retrieval, reduces system load, and enhances scalability for future growth.
